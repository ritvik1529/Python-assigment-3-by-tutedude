üìò Assignment 3 ‚Äì Functions & Modules in Python  
This repository contains solutions for Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python as part of Assignment 3.  
The tasks demonstrate the use of functions, recursion/loops, and Python‚Äôs built-in math module.

üßÆ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:

- Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.  
- Returns the calculated factorial.  
- Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.  

**File:** `Calculate Factorial Using a Function.py`

üìê Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:

- Asks the user for a number as input.  
- Uses the `math` module to calculate:  
  - The square root of the number  
  - The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
  - The sine of the number (in radians)  
- Displays the calculated results.  

**File:** `Using the Math Module for Calculations.py`

üöÄ How to Run the Programs  
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
4. Run the scripts using:  
   ```bash
   python "Calculate Factorial Using a Function.py"
   python "Using the Math Module for Calculations.py"
